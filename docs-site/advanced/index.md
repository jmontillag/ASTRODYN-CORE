# Advanced Docs (Repository Docs)

This docs site focuses on user onboarding, tutorials, and API reference.
Advanced architecture and design documents remain in the repository `docs/`
folder for maintainers and contributors.

## Key advanced docs in the repo

- `docs/extending-propagators.md`
- `docs/api-governance.md`
- `docs/geqoe-cpp-architecture.md`
- `docs/implementation-plan.md`
- `docs/archive/architecture-hardening-plan.md` (archived migration record)

## Tip

Keep this page as a stable bridge while user-facing docs are expanded. Later, the
most important advanced docs can be migrated into the MkDocs site directly.
