# Reference

The reference section is split into:

- **API reference** (generated from docstrings)
- **Troubleshooting** (setup/runtime/build issues)
- **Advanced docs** (architecture and extension guidance)

## Notes

- API pages are scaffolded and will improve as docstring coverage expands.
- Existing advanced design docs remain in the repository `docs/` folder and are
  linked from the Advanced section.
