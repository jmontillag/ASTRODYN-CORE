# How-To / Cookbook

This section provides short, task-oriented guides.

Each recipe should aim to include:

1. A **self-contained example** (usable by `pip` users without the repo `examples/` folder)
2. A link to the **extended repo example** (when available)
3. Expected outputs and common pitfalls

## Initial recipe targets

- compare propagator fidelity levels
- tune gravity field degree/order
- parse OEM and build ephemeris workflows
- perform SMA maintenance analysis
- validate orbital conversions

For now, use:

- `examples/cookbook/`
- `examples/README.md`

## Available recipes

- [TLE Propagation from Two Lines (Self-Contained)](tle-propagation-from-lines.md)
- [Numerical Propagation from a Typed Initial State (Self-Contained)](numerical-propagation-from-state.md)
- [Export a Trajectory from a Propagator (YAML / HDF5)](export-trajectory-from-propagator.md)
- [Validate an Orbit Representation Round-Trip](orbit-representation-roundtrip.md)
